The game takes place in modern-day Paris, during an exclusive event at a prestigious art museum. The evening was meant to celebrate the unveiling of a new exhibition featuring rare and valuable artifacts. High-profile guests, including artists, critics, and collectors, gathered for the occasion. However, the festivities took a dark turn when Mathieu Renaud, a renowned art dealer, was found dead in a restricted exhibit hall under mysterious circumstances.

The event is set in the late evening, and the museum is now in lockdown as the investigation begins. Guests and staff are being questioned, each with their own story, alibi, and potential motives. The player assumes the role of a skilled investigator tasked with uncovering the truth by interrogating NPCs, analyzing evidence, and piecing together the timeline of events.

Key contextual details include:
	•	Temporal Context: The murder happened between 9:30 PM and 10:00 PM, during the peak of the event. The timeline is critical for identifying inconsistencies in NPC statements.
	•	Environmental Context:
	•	The museum is a sprawling historical building with multiple rooms, including the grand hall where the reception took place, the restricted exhibit hall (the crime scene), and several staff-only areas.
	•	The security system was partially operational, but some cameras failed at key moments due to “technical issues.”

The atmosphere is tense, with guests anxious to clear their names and staff fearful of the scandal’s impact on their careers. Some NPCs are forthcoming, while others withhold information or lie to protect their secrets.

    The player is an investigator.
